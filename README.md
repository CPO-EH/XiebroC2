## Features

- The client side (Implant) is written in Golang, compatible with Windows, Linux, MacOS (mobile platforms are under consideration for future updates).
- The team server (Teamserver) is written in .net 8.0 and AOT compiled, featuring low memory usage without the need for any dependencies, nearly compatible with all platform systems.
- The controller supports reverse shell, file management, process management, network traffic monitoring, memory loading, reverse proxy (based on [IOX](https://github.com/EddieIvan01/iox) model), and screenshots.
- Supports in-memory loading of PE files on Windows/Linux, allowing the execution of trojans without dropping files to disk, and facilitating the use of third-party C2/RATs.
- Supports in-memory execution of .net assemblies (execute-assembly, inline-assembly).
- Supports extension of UI widgets, Session commands, and payload generation through lua (similar to CobaltStrike's cna scripts).
- Custom RDI shellcode support (64-bit only, 32-bit requires manual client compilation) or use [donut](https://github.com/TheWover/donut), [Godonut](https://github.com/Binject/go-donut) to generate your own shellcode.
- Teamserver supports hosting binary files, text, pictures (similar to SimpleHttpServer).
- Customizable team server configuration files, with custom Telegram chat ID/Token for notifications.
- The Controller UI is lightweight, with memory usage approximately 1/60th of CobaltStrike and 1/10th of Metasploit.
- Golang's compiler features have been blacklisted by some AV/EDR manufacturers, resulting in poor evasion capabilities.

The payload in XiebroC2 currently only supports the x64-bit AMD architecture. If you have application scenarios in other environments, you need to compile the Go source code yourself.

## TODO

- Currently, only the Session mode of the TCP/WebSocket protocol is supported. They are replacements for https. We will consider developing a reliable UDP protocol and support the Beacon mode in the future.
- Consider developing Powershell, VBscript, Hta, Jscript and other payloads.
- Open more forms and API interfaces to facilitate Lua extension plug-ins
